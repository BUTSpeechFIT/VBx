This directory contains the rttms files corresponding to the numbers we report in the repository and in "Bayesian HMM clustering of x-vector sequences (VBx) in speaker diarization: theory, implementation and analysis on standard tasks"

We also share here the lists of files comprising each of the sets (dev/test). For CALLHOME, there is no dev/test partition but part1 and part2.
